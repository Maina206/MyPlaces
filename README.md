## Setup Instructions

### 1. Get Google Maps API Key

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. **Enable billing** (required even for free tier usage)
4. Enable the following APIs:
   - Maps JavaScript API
   - Places API
5. Create credentials (API Key)
6. (Optional) Restrict the API key to your domain for security

### 2. Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root:

\`\`\`
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
\`\`\`

**⚠️ Important Security Notes:**

- Never commit `.env.local` to version control
- The `.gitignore` file is configured to exclude environment files
- For production deployment, set environment variables in your hosting platform

### 3. Install and Run

\`\`\`bash
npm install
npm run dev
\`\`\`

## Deployment

### Vercel Deployment

1. Push your code to GitHub (`.env.local` will be ignored)
2. Connect your repository to Vercel
3. In Vercel dashboard, go to your project settings
4. Add environment variable:
   - Name: `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`
   - Value: Your Google Maps API key
5. Redeploy your application

### Other Platforms

For other hosting platforms, make sure to:

1. Set the `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` environment variable
2. Ensure your API key allows requests from your production domain
3. Consider adding domain restrictions to your API key for security

## Security Best Practices

### API Key Security

- **Domain Restrictions**: In production, restrict your API key to your specific domain
- **API Restrictions**: Limit the key to only Maps JavaScript API and Places API
- **Monitoring**: Set up billing alerts and monitor API usage
- **Rotation**: Regularly rotate your API keys

### Environment Variables

- Never hardcode API keys in your source code
- Use `.env.local` for local development
- Set environment variables in your hosting platform for production
- Different keys for development/staging/production environments

## How to Use

1. **Add a Place**: Click anywhere on the map, then enter a name for the location
2. **Search**: Use the search bar to find specific locations
3. **Navigate**: Click on any saved place in the sidebar to center the map
4. **Delete**: Use the trash icon next to any place to remove it
5. **View Details**: Click on map markers to see place information
